This amazing technique has multiple applications in the fields of AI and data science. In this project, we will explore audio classification using deep learning concepts involving algorithms like Artificial Neural Network (ANN), 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN1D), and CNN2D. The dataset contains 8732 labelled sound excerpts (=4s) of urban sounds from ten categories: air for audio prediction, car horns, children playing, dog barking, drilling, engine idling, gunshots, jackhammers, sirens, and street music are used for audio prediction. Before we develop models, we do some basic data preprocessing and feature extraction on audio signals. As a result, each model is compared in terms of accuracy, training time, and prediction time. This is explained by model deployment, where users are allowed to load a desired sound output for each model being deployed successfully, which will be discussed in detail.",

The database is SQLite, and the program is created with flutter. Flutter makes developing cross-platform apps simple. Flutter was the ideal choice for our solution because it is available on numerous platforms and has a shorter time to market. The expense tracker function is designed to keep track of spending by allowing users to enter transactions and generate bar charts that show the percentage of total expenses. The pedometer plugin is also used to calculate steps. It will also have goals (for motivating the user).
